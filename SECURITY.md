## Security Design Principles (CIAO)

This project follows **[CIAO](https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao)** / **CIAO-Lite** defensive design. Security-relevant intent:

| Letter | Principle | Security application |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| **C** | **Caution** | Assume missing tools. Fail closed on an unknown verb and on a pip failure. Do not claim a welcome when the command did not run. |
| **I** | **Intentional** | The welcome line is the same sentence on the terminal and on menu row 1. This program does not join media or list files in the folder. |
| **A** | **Anti-fragile** | Multi-mount publish (USB vs system temp) is designed via staging + `shutil.move`. Unique temps avoid fixed cwd race names. |
| **O** | **Over-protect** | Protection Zones on staging/publish helpers; least privilege day-to-day (user-level CLI; no root elevation product surface). |

This section describes **design posture**. It is **not** a claim of third-party certification.

## Scope notes

- ThreeDimensionModeller is a **local** interactive CLI. It does **not** implement online install channels or companion `.sha256` download integrity. The model verb reads outline images in a folder you choose and writes `model.glb` and `viewer.html`. It does not download weights.
- Prefer keeping untrusted media and scripts offline unless you trust their origin.
