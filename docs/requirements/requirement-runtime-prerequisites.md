**Area**: runtime
**Key**: `requirement-runtime-prerequisites`
**Philosophy**: CIAO **v2.10.2** / CIAO-Lite (Caution • Intentional • Anti-fragile • Over-engineered / Over-protect)

## 1. Purpose

Declare the host and Python runtime prerequisites required to run ThreeDimensionModeller. This product does not implement a privileged installer. This file is the documentation and validation SSOT for what must already be present. The pip strings are `requirement-python-dependency-management`.

### 1.1 Human-facing

**In one sentence:** You need Python, ChronicleLogger, and the image stack. No encoder is required.

| Box | Meaning | Example |
|-----|---------|---------|
| You / this login | Person about to build a model from a folder of outlines | Pip already installed the image stack |
| The other role | pip | Installs ThreeDimensionModeller, ChronicleLogger, numpy, opencv-python-headless, and scikit-image |
| Not this file | The menu picture and the outline steps | TUI and the domain file |

| Includes | Excludes |
|----------|----------|
| The image stack as pip packages | A claim that a host `ffmpeg` binary is required |
| ChronicleLogger `>=1.3.1`, required | Calling that library optional |
| A console next step when a required import is missing | Root auto-install |

| Surface | What you open | What for |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| pip | ChronicleLogger, numpy, opencv-python-headless, scikit-image | Status file and the glTF model |
| About page | Runtime-tools line | The word `none`. Does not probe PATH (`requirement-python-about`) |
| First model build that has an outline | Vision stack | Imported only when the folder has a supported image. No weight download |

| You do… | What it means | What you type |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Install the Python package | You get ThreeDimensionModeller, the status library, and the image stack. | `python -m pip install ThreeDimensionModeller` |
| Convert an empty folder | The program returns 0 and does not load the model. | `three-dimension-modeller model` |
| Start with the logger library missing | The console prints the pip next step and returns non-zero. | `three-dimension-modeller` |

## 2. Core Rules (Mandatory)

### 2.1 Scope

1. **MUST** document every external tool required at runtime.
2. **MUST NOT** claim the product auto-installs system packages via root or sudo.
3. **MUST** separate pip-installable Python dependencies from system binaries.

### 2.2 Required runtime components

| Component | Kind | Required for | Install surface |
|-----------|------|--------------|-----------------|
| CPython `>=3.10` | interpreter | package import and the CLI | OS, pyenv, or the system Python. This product does not require you to install pyenv |
| ChronicleLogger `>=1.3.1` | pip package | the one status logger | `requirement-python-dependency-management`. Required, not optional |
| `numpy>=2.3.0`, `opencv-python-headless>=5.0.0.93`, `scikit-image>=0.25.0` | pip packages | a model when the folder has a supported outline | `requirement-python-dependency-management`. Required. An empty folder does not import them |
| FFmpeg | not required | nothing in this product | not installed and not checked |

### 2.3 Validation

4. **MUST NOT** fail because `ffmpeg` is missing. The front board and `model` do not look for it.
5. The front board **MAY** open when the image stack is not imported yet. About does not probe those packages and does not install them.
6. **MUST** document that FFmpeg is not installed by `pip install ThreeDimensionModeller` and is not required.
7. **MUST** document the input formats as the domain format set.
8. If `ChronicleLogger` cannot be imported, `def main` **MUST** print the pip next step and return non-zero (`requirement-python-cli-logging`). That line is console text. The library is required. If the image stack cannot be imported while a folder has a supported image, `model` **MUST** print the pip next step and return 1.

### 2.4 Privilege

9. **MUST NOT** require root to satisfy runtime prerequisites for normal use.
10. Type 1 elevation is out of scope.

### 2.5 Implementation Notes (this project)

| Item | Value |
|------|--------|
| **Python package install** | `python -m pip install ThreeDimensionModeller`, or `python -m pip install -e .` from a checkout |
| **Declared pip dependency (law)** | The four strings in `requirement-python-dependency-management`. All required |
| **Live manifest** | `pyproject.toml` lists those four strings. `requires-python` is `>=3.10` |
| **System binary** | none. `ffmpeg` is not required |
| **Auto install command** | none. The product does not run a root install. The build does not download weights |
| **Platform notes** | Linux primary. macOS and Windows when CPython is available |
| **Product version** | 1.0.0 |
| **Startup check** | No encoder check. The image stack is imported only when the chosen folder has a supported image |
| **User docs** | Root `README.md` names the pip image stack and says no external media tool is required |

### 2.6 Why This Requirement Exists (CIAO)

- **Principle 1 – Caution**: A missing image library is reported when an image is actually converted.
- **Principle 10 – Least privilege**: No root installer.
- **Principle 2 – Intentional**: The pip libraries and a host encoder are different facts. This product has no host encoder.

## Under command line for normal user only

On Termux, Git Bash, Windows cmd, or the same class, the normal user installs the pip package. **This requirement:** do not use administrator privilege, `sudo`, `apt`, or a dedicated system user to install ChronicleLogger or the image stack from inside ThreeDimensionModeller. Do not pipe a downloaded script into a shell. Type 1 and Type 2 are unused on Termux, Git Bash, and Windows cmd. Git Bash and Windows cmd do not call Termux `pkg`.

## 3. Design Principles (CIAO / CIAO-Lite)

- **Caution:** Document a missing library before the conversion claims success.
- **Intentional:** pip installs the image stack. It does not install FFmpeg. ChronicleLogger is required.
- **Anti-fragile:** An empty folder still returns 0 without the model.
- **Over-protect:** No silent root install.

## 4. Protection Rule (Sacred)

**Future AI assistants, Grok, or maintainers MUST NOT**:

1. Claim FFmpeg is installed by `pip install ThreeDimensionModeller`, or claim this product requires it.
2. Add a root package-manager install from this product.
3. Treat a missing `ffmpeg` binary as a failed model build.
4. Store secrets in this file.
5. Drop numpy, opencv-python-headless, or scikit-image while `model` still imports them for a folder that has an image.
6. Call ChronicleLogger optional.

**Violating this rule is a critical honesty regression.**

## 5. Acceptance criteria

| ID | Criterion |
|----|-----------|
| AC-1 | FFmpeg is listed as not required |
| AC-2 | ChronicleLogger is required at `>=1.3.1`, and the image floors are `requirement-python-dependency-management` |
| AC-3 | No root auto-install claim |
| AC-4 | A missing image library on a folder that has an image produces the pip next step |
| AC-5 | Missing ChronicleLogger produces the pip next step and a non-zero return |
