**Area**: python
**Key**: `requirement-python-cli-interface`
**Philosophy**: CIAO **v2.10.2** / CIAO-Lite (Caution • Intentional • Anti-fragile • Over-engineered / Over-protect)

## 1. Purpose

Define the official command-line entry points, empty-argv behavior, and typed verbs for the ThreeDimensionModeller Python package.

The text-menu picture is `requirement-python-tui`. Outline steps and formats are `requirement-domain-threedimensionmodeller`. The about page is `requirement-python-about`. The domain sentence stays on the domain file. The logger construct is `requirement-python-cli-logging`. Class homes are `requirement-python-oop`. The encoder file is Retired.

`def main` writes `ChronicleLogger(...)` and then constructs `Cli`. The argument parser runs after that construct and after the debug block. The allowed end state is this file.

### 1.1 Human-facing

**In one sentence:** `three-dimension-modeller` with no words opens the numbered menu on a terminal, and with no terminal it prints help and stops.

| Box | Meaning | Example |
|-----|---------|---------|
| You / this login | Person at the keyboard or in a script | `three-dimension-modeller` or `three-dimension-modeller model` |
| The other role | The menu picture and the outline facts | `requirement-python-tui`, `requirement-domain-threedimensionmodeller` |
| Not this file | How the frame is drawn, and how one image becomes an outline | TUI and the domain file |

| Includes | Excludes |
|----------|----------|
| Console script, module entry, typed verbs, empty-argv menu or help | A shell installer on empty argv |
| `model`, an optional folder, and `--views`, `--grid`, and `--output`, also owned by the domain file | A numbered row for `help` |
| Pip verbs `version-check`, `self-update`, `self-install`, `self-uninstall`, also owned by the text menu | `sudo` pip, or a downloaded script piped into a shell |

| Surface | What you open | What for |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| `three-dimension-modeller` on a terminal | Front board | Menu. Does not convert a folder |
| `three-dimension-modeller` with no terminal | Help text | Exit 0 |
| `three-dimension-modeller model` | The terminal | Convert one folder. No menu and no prompt |
| `three-dimension-modeller help` | Help text | Verb list. Does not draw the menu |

| You do… | What it means | What you type |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Start on a terminal | The front board opens. Pip does not run. | `three-dimension-modeller` |
| Start in a script | Help text, exit 0. | `three-dimension-modeller` |
| Convert a folder | `model.glb` and `viewer.html` in that folder's `model` directory. No menu. | `three-dimension-modeller model` |
| Check or change the install | Pip runs only when you ask. Empty argv does not. | `three-dimension-modeller version-check` |

## 2. Core Rules (Mandatory)

### 2.1 Entry points

1. **MUST** expose a console script entry named `three-dimension-modeller` pointing at `ThreeDimensionModeller.cli:main` (declared in packaging SSOT).
2. **MUST** support module execution: `python -m ThreeDimensionModeller`.
3. **MUST** keep `def main` in `src/ThreeDimensionModeller/cli.py` as the single runtime entry. `main` writes `ChronicleLogger(...)` before it constructs `Cli` (`requirement-python-cli-logging`, `requirement-python-oop`).
4. **MUST NOT** require root or sudo to run the CLI.

### 2.2 Empty argv

5. On a terminal, bare invocation (`three-dimension-modeller` with no args, or `python -m ThreeDimensionModeller` with no args) **MUST** open the front board in `requirement-python-tui`. It **MUST NOT** convert a folder. It **MUST NOT** run pip.
6. When stdout is not a terminal, bare invocation **MUST** print help and return 0. It **MUST NOT** draw the text screen and **MUST NOT** wait.
7. **MUST NOT** default empty argv to a shell-channel install or to self-update.

### 2.3 Typed verbs

8. `ArgumentParser.parse_args` **MUST** run after `ChronicleLogger(...)` and after the debug block.
9. The typed verbs are `help`, `version`, `about`, `model`, `self-install`, `version-check`, `self-update`, and `self-uninstall`. Each one is operational. **MUST NOT** add a verb whose only purpose is a test. **MUST NOT** add `hello`, `join`, or `list-videos`. `language` is not a typed verb. Menu row 4 owns it (`requirement-python-cli-language`). **MUST NOT** add `language` to `PRODUCT_VERBS`.
10. A folder operand and `--views`, `--grid`, and `--output` are legal only on `model`. On any other verb they **MUST** be an error. `model` **MUST NOT** scan subfolders for images.
11. On a terminal, `model` **MUST NOT** draw the text screen and **MUST NOT** prompt. `about` **MUST** open the about page.
12. With no terminal, `about` **MUST** print the about page and return 0. It does not draw the text screen. `model` **MUST** convert and return the code from `requirement-domain-threedimensionmodeller`. It does not draw the text screen.
13. `help` and `model` **MUST NOT** draw the text screen. `help` returns 0. `model` with no folder converts the current directory. The default format is png. Menu row 1 opens the folder board and does not run this verb by itself.
14. `version` **MUST** print `__version__` and **MUST NOT** call pip and **MUST NOT** draw the text screen.
15. `version-check`, `self-update`, `self-install`, and `self-uninstall` **MUST NOT** open the text screen. The commands are:

| Verb | Command |
|------|---------|
| `version-check` | `python -m pip index versions ThreeDimensionModeller` |
| `self-update` | `python -m pip install --upgrade ThreeDimensionModeller` |
| `self-install` | `python -m pip install ThreeDimensionModeller` |
| `self-uninstall` | `python -m pip uninstall -y ThreeDimensionModeller` only when `--force` is also present |

`self-uninstall` without `--force` **MUST** print the next step and return non-zero. The package stays installed. These commands **MUST NOT** use `sudo` and **MUST NOT** use `curl`. Empty argv **MUST NOT** run `self-install` or `self-update`.

Every typed verb is named again by its topic owner. Help text is not that second mention.

| Verb | Second mention |
|------|----------------|
| `help`, `model`, `version` | This file for `help`. `model` is also pillar A of `requirement-domain-threedimensionmodeller`. `version` is also row 82 on `requirement-python-tui` |
| `about` | `requirement-python-about` and row 83. The domain sentence stays on pillar D of `requirement-domain-threedimensionmodeller` |
| `self-install`, `version-check`, `self-update`, `self-uninstall` | Rows 84–87 on `requirement-python-tui` |

`language` is not in this table. The second mention of that ban is `requirement-python-cli-language`.

Complete invocation samples:

```text
three-dimension-modeller
three-dimension-modeller help
three-dimension-modeller model
three-dimension-modeller model photos --views views.json --grid 96
three-dimension-modeller version
three-dimension-modeller about
three-dimension-modeller self-install
three-dimension-modeller version-check
three-dimension-modeller self-update
three-dimension-modeller self-uninstall --force
python -m ThreeDimensionModeller
```

### 2.4 Model build

These rules are the `model` verb. The domain file owns the image steps, the folder board, and the output name. They are not what empty argv does.

16. **MUST** accept an optional folder. When it is omitted, the folder is the current directory.
17. **MUST** accept `--views`, `--grid`, and `--output` as the domain file defines them. **MUST NOT** accept `--format`.
18. **MUST NOT** prompt. **MUST NOT** draw the text screen.
19. A missing folder, a bad grid, or a bad views file **MUST** return 1 with a next-step line.
20. A folder with no supported image **MUST** return 0 and **MUST NOT** import the image stack.
21. One failed image **MUST** be reported. The remaining images still run. Any failure makes the exit code 1.
22. The checkout entry `./convert.py` **MUST** call the same conversion.
23. When `model` or `./convert.py` is about to convert images, this caller **MUST** print the waiting sentence from `requirement-domain-threedimensionmodeller` and flush before the blocking call. The choice token is `model` for the verb and `convert.py` for the script. Returned lines still start with the sentences that were shown. This caller **MUST** print only the remainder, so each sentence appears once. There is no download sentence. `help`, `version`, `about`, and the pip verbs **MUST NOT** announce. The domain file owns the words.

Menu row 1 asks which folder. That question is `requirement-python-tui`. Esc there returns to the front board and does not convert.

### 2.5 Flags

24. The parser accepts the verbs in rule 9. `help` is also available as `--help`.
25. This product does not claim `--json`. **MUST NOT** add it in this file.
26. **MUST NOT** add `--debug`. Debug status is the environment gate on `requirement-python-cli-logging`.
27. **MUST NOT** add a second pair of input paths. The one folder operand belongs to `model` only.

### 2.6 Output behavior

28. Outline progress and failures **MUST** be visible to the operator. On the text screen they are the result page. Off the text screen they are console lines.
29. Durable status **MUST** go through ChronicleLogger once `main` has constructed it (`requirement-python-cli-logging`). The console failure sentence remains required.
30. **MUST NOT** mix a machine-only JSON mode into the session. This product does not claim `--json`.

### 2.7 No encoder

31. The front board **MUST** be allowed to open when `ffmpeg` is missing. This product does not look for it.
32. `model` **MUST NOT** spawn an encoder. A missing image library fails only when the folder has a supported image (`requirement-runtime-prerequisites`).
33. The about page runtime-tools line is `none` (`requirement-python-about`). It does not probe `PATH`.

### 2.8 Implementation Notes (this project)

| Item | Value |
|------|--------|
| **Console script** | `three-dimension-modeller = ThreeDimensionModeller.cli:main` |
| **Module entry** | `src/ThreeDimensionModeller/__main__.py` → `main()` |
| **CLI module** | `src/ThreeDimensionModeller/cli.py` defines `Cli` and `def main` in the allowed end state |
| **Empty argv, terminal** | Front board. No conversion. No pip |
| **Empty argv, no terminal** | Help text. Return 0 |
| **Parser** | After ChronicleLogger and the debug block |
| **Quiet / JSON** | Text screen sets `is_quiet=True` on the logger construct. No `--json` |
| **Privilege** | user-level only |
| **Model** | `Cli._verb_model` calls `convert_folder`. It prints the waiting sentence and flushes, then prints only the remainder. It does not draw the menu |
| **Product version** | `1.0.1` |
| **User docs** | Root `README.md` Usage matches this contract |

### 2.9 Why This Requirement Exists (CIAO)

- **Principle 2 – Intentional**: Entry, empty argv, and each typed verb are explicit.
- **Principle 16 – Interactive awareness**: A terminal opens the menu. No terminal prints help and returns 0.
- **Principle 5 – SSOT**: Verb names live here and on the topic owner. The picture lives on the TUI requirement.
- **Principle 10 – Least privilege**: Pip verbs do not use sudo.

## Under command line for normal user only

On Termux, Git Bash, Windows cmd, or the same class, the person runs `three-dimension-modeller` as the normal user. **This requirement:** do not use administrator privilege, `sudo`, `apt`, or a dedicated system user to start the program or to run the pip verbs. Do not pipe a downloaded script into a shell. Type 1 and Type 2 are unused on Termux, Git Bash, and Windows cmd. Git Bash and Windows cmd do not call Termux `pkg`.

## 3. Design Principles (CIAO / CIAO-Lite)

- **Caution:** A missing folder does not write an outline. An empty folder does not load the model.
- **Intentional:** Empty argv is the menu on a terminal and help off a terminal.
- **Anti-fragile:** Module entry and the console script both call `main`.
- **Over-protect:** Empty argv does not install, update, or convert a folder.

## 4. Protection Rule (Sacred)

**Future AI assistants, Grok, or maintainers MUST NOT**:

1. Change empty argv into a shell-channel install.
2. Make empty argv convert a folder or run pip.
3. Make empty argv off a terminal exit non-zero. That path prints help and returns 0.
4. Remove the console script or the module entry without a packaging and docs update.
5. Require root to run `model`.
6. Add `hello`, `join`, or `list-videos` without a domain-law change.
7. Add `--json`, `--debug`, or `--format` in this file.
8. Treat help text as the second mention of a verb.
9. Add `language` as an argv verb. Row 4 is the menu language.
10. Start `model` or `./convert.py` image work without the domain waiting sentence, print that sentence a second time after it was already shown, or announce a download when the weights file is already a file.

**Violating this rule is a critical CLI regression.**

## 5. Acceptance criteria

| ID | Criterion |
|----|-----------|
| AC-1 | `three-dimension-modeller` entry declared in packaging |
| AC-2 | `python -m ThreeDimensionModeller` reaches `main` |
| AC-3 | Empty argv on a terminal opens the front board and does not convert and does not run pip |
| AC-4 | Empty argv with no terminal prints help and returns 0 |
| AC-5 | `model` does not draw the menu. A folder operand on another verb is an error |
| AC-6 | An empty folder returns 0. A missing folder returns 1 |
| AC-7 | Pip verbs match the command table and do not use sudo or curl |
| AC-8 | `model` and `./convert.py` print the domain waiting sentence and flush before the work, then print only the remainder. `version` does not announce |
