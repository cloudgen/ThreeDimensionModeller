**file**: docs/requirements/requirement-python-packaging.md
**Status**: Active (Version 1.2.6)
**Area**: python
**Key**: `requirement-python-packaging`
**Philosophy**: CIAO **v2.10.2** / CIAO-Lite (Caution • Intentional • Anti-fragile • Over-engineered / Over-protect)

## 1. Purpose

Define the packaging SSOT for the ThreeDimensionModeller Python distribution: `pyproject.toml`, metadata, dependencies, console entry points, and version consistency.

This file owns the manifest shape. The pip requirement strings are `requirement-python-dependency-management`. ChronicleLogger stays required. `requirements.txt` is not an authority.

### 1.1 Human-facing

**In one sentence:** ThreeDimensionModeller is a pip package named ThreeDimensionModeller, version 1.0.1. The status library and the image stack are required dependencies.

| Box | Meaning | Example |
|-----|---------|---------|
| You / this login | Person installing the package | `python -m pip install ThreeDimensionModeller` |
| The other role | The manifest | `pyproject.toml` names the version, the console script, and the dependencies |
| Not this file | What the menu does after install, and how an outline image is drawn | CLI, TUI, and the domain file |

| Includes | Excludes |
|----------|----------|
| Package name, version, console script `three-dimension-modeller`, required `ChronicleLogger>=1.3.1` | Re-exporting ChronicleLogger from the ThreeDimensionModeller package |
| Manifest floor `ChronicleLogger>=1.3.1`, same as this law | Calling the logger optional, or leaving the manifest at `>=1.2.3` |
| MIT license, homepage, Python range as declared | A claim that pip installs FFmpeg. FFmpeg is not a dependency |

| Surface | What you open | What for |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| `pyproject.toml` | `[project]` | Name, version, dependencies, console script |
| `src/ThreeDimensionModeller/__init__.py` | `__version__` | The same version string |
| pip | Install | `python -m pip install ThreeDimensionModeller` |

| You do… | What it means | What you type |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Install | pip installs ThreeDimensionModeller, the status library, and the image stack. It does not install FFmpeg. | `python -m pip install ThreeDimensionModeller` |
| Check the version | The badge, the manifest, and `__version__` are the same string. | Open `pyproject.toml` and `__init__.py` |
| Import the package | You get `__version__` and `main`. You do not get ChronicleLogger from this package. | `python -c "import ThreeDimensionModeller"` |

## 2. Core Rules (Mandatory)

### 2.1 Manifest SSOT

1. `pyproject.toml` **MUST** be the primary packaging manifest (PEP 517 / PEP 621).
2. **MUST** declare: name, version, description, authors, license text, requires-python, dependencies, build-system, and console scripts.
3. **MUST NOT** treat an ad-hoc `requirements.txt` as the primary product dependency SSOT.
4. A legacy `setup.py` under a build tree **MUST NOT** become a second source of runtime identity.

### 2.2 Version SSOT

5. The package version in `pyproject.toml` and `src/ThreeDimensionModeller/__init__.py` (`__version__`) **MUST** match when a release is claimed.
6. Bumping either **MUST** update both in the same change.
7. **MUST NOT** invent a third version constant. Display code **MUST NOT** keep a second literal, including a fallback `"1.0.0"` (`requirement-python-oop`). The current release string is `1.0.1`. A version bump is a user order, not a side effect of editing this file.

### 2.3 Dependencies

8. **MUST** declare runtime Python dependencies required for the shipped CLI.
9. The pip strings **MUST** be the list in `requirement-python-dependency-management`. ChronicleLogger **MUST** stay required at `ChronicleLogger>=1.3.1` and **MUST NOT** be optional. numpy, opencv-python-headless, and scikit-image **MUST** stay required, each with the specifier in that file. The live `pyproject.toml` `[project].dependencies` **MUST** be that same list.
10. FFmpeg **MUST NOT** be declared as a pip package. This product does not require that binary (`requirement-runtime-prerequisites`).
11. **MUST NOT** commit secrets or private index passwords into packaging files.
12. **MUST NOT** re-export `ChronicleLogger` from the ThreeDimensionModeller package.

### 2.4 Entry points

13. **MUST** declare console script `three-dimension-modeller` → `ThreeDimensionModeller.cli:main`.
14. The entry function **MUST** stay `def main` in `src/ThreeDimensionModeller/cli.py`. In the allowed end state, `main` constructs ChronicleLogger and then `Cli` (`requirement-python-cli-logging`, `requirement-python-oop`).

### 2.5 Build / release helpers

15. Optional `build.sh` / Cython tooling **MAY** exist for maintainer packaging.
16. **MUST** keep helper scripts consistent with `pyproject.toml` identity (project name ThreeDimensionModeller).
17. Generated `build/` and `dist/` **MUST NOT** be treated as source SSOT.

### 2.6 Implementation Notes (this project)

| Item | Value |
|------|--------|
| **Manifest** | `pyproject.toml` |
| **Project name** | `ThreeDimensionModeller` |
| **Version** | `1.0.1` |
| **requires-python** | `>=3.10` |
| **Dependencies (law)** | The four strings in `requirement-python-dependency-management`: `ChronicleLogger>=1.3.1`, `numpy>=2.3.0`, `opencv-python-headless>=5.0.0.93`, `scikit-image>=0.25.0` |
| **Dependencies (live manifest)** | The same four strings |
| **Build backend** | `setuptools.build_meta` |
| **Console script** | `three-dimension-modeller = ThreeDimensionModeller.cli:main` |
| **Homepage / repo** | `https://github.com/cloudgen/ThreeDimensionModeller` |
| **Maintainer build helper** | `build.sh` |
| **License** | MIT |
| **Public package exports** | `__version__`, `main` only. **MUST NOT** re-export `ChronicleLogger` |
| **User docs** | Root `README.md` Quick Installation documents pip and **MUST NOT** claim pip installs FFmpeg |
| **README version badge** | Must match packaging version when README claims complete (`1.0.1`) |

### 2.7 Why This Requirement Exists (CIAO)

- **Principle 5 – SSOT**: One manifest for identity and entry. One floor for ChronicleLogger.
- **Principle 2 – Intentional**: The live manifest lag is written down instead of being described as optional.
- **Principle 1 – Caution**: FFmpeg is not a dependency. The image stack is.

## Under command line for normal user only

On Termux, Git Bash, Windows cmd, or the same class, install and upgrade use pip as the normal user. **This requirement:** do not use administrator privilege, `sudo`, `apt`, or a dedicated system user to install ThreeDimensionModeller. Do not pipe a downloaded script into a shell. Type 1 and Type 2 are unused on Termux, Git Bash, and Windows cmd. Git Bash and Windows cmd do not call Termux `pkg`. The install line is `python -m pip install ThreeDimensionModeller`.

## 3. Design Principles (CIAO / CIAO-Lite)

- **Caution:** The version string has one home in the manifest and one matching `__version__`.
- **Intentional:** PEP 621 is the manifest. The logger floor is required.
- **Anti-fragile:** The console script and the module entry share `main`.
- **Over-protect:** No secrets in packaging files. No re-export of ChronicleLogger.

## 4. Protection Rule (Sacred)

**Future AI assistants, Grok, or maintainers MUST NOT**:

1. Remove or rename the `three-dimension-modeller` entry without a CLI and README update.
2. Let `__version__` and `pyproject.toml` diverge while claiming a release.
3. Add private credentials to `pyproject.toml`.
4. Replace the packaging SSOT with only `requirements.txt`.
5. Change the product name silently.
6. Mark ChronicleLogger optional, or leave the manifest at `>=1.2.3` once the packaging file is edited for the floor.
7. Re-export ChronicleLogger from the package.
8. Bump the product version as a side effect of editing this requirement.

**Violating this rule is a critical packaging regression.**

## 5. Acceptance criteria

| ID | Criterion |
|----|-----------|
| AC-1 | `pyproject.toml` names ThreeDimensionModeller |
| AC-2 | Console script `three-dimension-modeller` is declared |
| AC-3 | Law and the live manifest both require `ChronicleLogger>=1.3.1` |
| AC-4 | Version matches `__init__.py` when a release is claimed (`1.0.1`) |
| AC-5 | FFmpeg is not a pip dependency. The image strings match `requirement-python-dependency-management` |
| AC-6 | Public exports are `__version__` and `main` only |
