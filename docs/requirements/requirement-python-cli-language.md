**Key**: `requirement-python-cli-language`
**Philosophy**: CIAO **v2.10.2** / CIAO-Lite (Caution • Intentional • Anti-fragile • Over-engineered / Over-protect)

## 1. Purpose

This file owns the menu language for ThreeDimensionModeller. The text menu can show its boards in one of thirteen languages. English is the default. The person picks a language on front row **4**. The pick is saved for the next run. The picture of the menu stays on `requirement-python-tui`. Typed verbs stay on `requirement-python-cli-interface`. `language` is not one of those verbs.

Class `MenuLanguage` in `src/ThreeDimensionModeller/menu_language.py` holds the codes, the saved leaf, and the words. Class `MenuPainter` writes `MenuLanguage(...)` in its constructor and asks that object for the path word and the row text. A factory does not create it.

### 1.1 Human-facing

**In one sentence:** On the ThreeDimensionModeller menu, you type **4** to pick the language the menu uses, and the next time you open the menu it still uses that language.

| Box | Meaning | Example |
|-----|---------|---------|
| You / this login | The person at the keyboard | `three-dimension-modeller`, then `4` |
| The other role | The menu language object | class `MenuLanguage` in `menu_language.py` |
| Not this file | Outline result lines, pip output, help, and the about page | Those stay English in this version |

| Includes | Excludes |
|----------|----------|
| Front row 4, the language board, the saved file, and the words on the menu boards | A `language` argument on the command line |
| English as the default when the file is missing or not a known code | Reading `LANG` or `LC_ALL` to pick the menu language |
| The path word, board titles, category names, Back, Exit, and the choice warning | Translating the folder path, the clock, a directory name, or a leaf command token such as `model` |

| Surface | What you open | What for |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| `three-dimension-modeller` on a terminal | Front board | Row **4** is language. Row **3** is system-log |
| `~/.local/ThreeDimensionModeller/language` | One-line file in this login’s home | The code saved from the menu |
| `THREEDIMENSIONMODELLER_LANG` | Environment value for this process | Wins over the file and does not write it |

| You do… | What it means | What you type |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Open the language board | The board lists thirteen language names in their own script, numbered 41 through 53, then Back. Numbers 40 and 54 through 59 are not printed. | `4` |
| Save Traditional Chinese | The file stores `zh-Hant`. The front board comes back in Traditional Chinese, and the line above the box says the menu language is Traditional Chinese. | `43` |
| Go back | The file is not written. The front board stays in the language you already had. | `0`, or Esc |
| Start with no saved language | The menu is English. A Traditional Chinese locale does not switch it. | `three-dimension-modeller` |

## 2. Core Rules (Mandatory)

1. **One owner.** This file selects the menu language and owns the words the menu boards print. `requirement-python-tui` draws the path line and the rows. It does not detect a language. `language` **MUST NOT** be an argv verb. `requirement-python-cli-interface` states the same ban.
2. **Default.** The code **MUST** be `en` when the leaf is missing, when the first line is empty, or when that line is not one of the thirteen codes. An invalid first line **MUST NOT** be rewritten. `LANG`, `LANGUAGE`, `LC_ALL`, and `LC_MESSAGES` **MUST NOT** select a code. This file does not use gettext.
3. **Process override.** When `THREEDIMENSIONMODELLER_LANG` is one of the thirteen codes, that code **MUST** win at process start. That start **MUST NOT** write the leaf. Any other value of `THREEDIMENSIONMODELLER_LANG` is ignored and the leaf is read.
4. **Leaf.** The leaf is `${HOME}/.local/ThreeDimensionModeller/language`. The program reads only the first line, ignores a trailing carriage return, and ignores later lines. A menu pick **MUST** write the code, one newline, and nothing else. The directory **MUST** be mode `0700`. The file **MUST** be mode `0600`. The program creates that directory only when a pick is saved. A missing home, or a write that fails, **MUST** keep the code this process already had and **MUST** show the failed-write line in that previous language. The front board **MUST** still return.
5. **Front row 4.** On every host, including Termux, Git Bash, and Windows cmd, the front board **MUST** print row **4** `language`. That row **MUST** open the language board. It **MUST NOT** run a command and **MUST NOT** leave the program. Row **2** stays omitted. Rows **1**, **8**, and **9** stay model, self-management, and Exit. System-log is front row **3**. Its children are **31** view-log, **32** clear-log, and **33** log-folder. Those numbers are the picture on `requirement-python-tui`.
6. **Language block.** The language board uses the twenty numbers **40** through **59**. Assigned rows are **41** through **53**, in the order below. **40** and **54** through **59** are reserved. They **MUST NOT** be printed. Typing a reserved number **MUST** show the unknown-choice line and **MUST NOT** write the leaf. **0**, an empty Enter on Back, and Esc **MUST** return to the front board and **MUST NOT** write the leaf.
7. **Names on the language board.** Each assigned row **MUST** show that language’s endonym as the short, in every UI language. The explain **MUST** be that UI language’s sentence with the endonym in the name slot. The English sentence is `use {name} for this menu`.
8. **What follows the code.** On the front board, the folder board, the language board, the system-log board, and the self-management board, these follow the selected code: the path label, the board title, category shorts, category longs, leaf longs, Back, Exit, the unknown-choice line, the saved-language line, and the failed-write line. Leaf shorts stay the English tokens `model`, `current`, `view-log`, `clear-log`, `log-folder`, `version`, `about`, `version-check`, `self-update`, `self-uninstall`, and `self-install`. A subfolder's short is that directory's name.
9. **What stays English.** Outline result lines, command output, pip lifecycle output, the argv `version` line, the help body, and the about page stay English in this version. The key hint `Up/Down  •  Enter` stays English. The folder path, each directory name, and the clock `HH:MM:SS` are not translated. The product name and the version stay on the status line. The folder-board title and the explains for current and for a subfolder follow the selected code.
10. **After a successful pick.** The session **MUST** show the saved-language line and **MUST** redraw the front board in the new language. That line sits above the box. It is not the error line. It stays until the next key. A failed write uses the same place, in the language that was current before the failure.
11. **Unknown choice.** A number or a word that is not on the current board **MUST** stay on that board and show the unknown-choice line in the selected language. It **MUST NOT** exit the process and **MUST NOT** write the leaf. The English line is `That choice is not on this list. Pick a listed number.`
12. **Clock.** The language board is a clock board. The one-second wait from `requirement-python-tui` rule 13 includes it. A language pick does not open a result page.
13. **Construct.** `MenuPainter.__init__` writes `MenuLanguage(...)`. The session and the model share that painter, so a save updates the rows the next paint reads. The site does not call a factory. `def main` stays in `src/ThreeDimensionModeller/cli.py`.
14. Actor / role / subject / approver: **considered**. No dest machine. No approver. The table stays on `requirement-class-software-dev.md`. This file does **not** add an actor requirement.
15. Dest fence conditions: **considered — none**. Do not invent one.

| Item | Value |
|------|--------|
| **Class** | `MenuLanguage` in `src/ThreeDimensionModeller/menu_language.py` |
| **Painter site** | `MenuPainter.__init__` writes `MenuLanguage(logger=logger, home=home)` |
| **Front row** | **4** language. Children **41**–**53**. Reserved and not printed: **40**, **54**–**59** |
| **System-log** | Front **3**. Children **31** view-log, **32** clear-log, **33** log-folder |
| **Leaf** | `${HOME}/.local/ThreeDimensionModeller/language`. Directory mode `0700`. File mode `0600`. Not the cache folder. Not `/var/ThreeDimensionModeller` |
| **Override** | `THREEDIMENSIONMODELLER_LANG` at process start. Does not write |
| **Back / Exit shorts** | en Back / Exit. zh-Hans 返回 / 离开. zh-Hant 返回 / 離開. es Atrás / Salir. ar رجوع / خروج. fr Retour / Quitter. pt Voltar / Sair. ru Назад / Выход. de Zurück / Beenden. ja 戻る / 終了. ko 뒤로 / 종료. nl Terug / Afsluiten. el Πίσω / Έξοδος |
| **Category shorts** | language: language, 语言, 語言, idioma, لغة, langue, язык, Sprache, 言語, 언어, taal, γλώσσα. Spanish and Portuguese both use idioma. system-log and self-management shorts are the words in `MenuLanguage` for that code. The English tokens stay `system-log` and `self-management` |
| **Language-board tokens** | 41 `english` / `en` / `English`. 42 `simplified-chinese` / `zh-hans` / `zh-Hans` / `简体中文`. 43 `traditional-chinese` / `zh-hant` / `zh-Hant` / `繁體中文`. 44 `spanish` / `es` / `Español` / `español`. 45 `arabic` / `ar` / `العربية` / `عربي`. 46 `french` / `fr` / `Français` / `français`. 47 `portuguese` / `pt` / `Português` / `português` / `portugues`. 48 `russian` / `ru` / `Русский` / `русский`. 49 `german` / `de` / `Deutsch` / `deutsch`. 50 `japanese` / `ja` / `日本語`. 51 `korean` / `ko` / `한국어`. 52 `dutch` / `nl` / `Nederlands` / `nederlands`. 53 `greek` / `el` / `Ελληνικά` / `ελληνικά` |
| **About leaf long (en)** | `version and this computer`. The other twelve codes say that fact in that language. The about page stays English and is `requirement-python-about` |
| **Not a verb** | `language` is absent from `Cli.PRODUCT_VERBS` |
| **Proof** | `TP-LANG-01` has. `TP-TUI-09` still proves that `LANG` does not select `路徑` when the leaf is missing |

Worked leaf, this login, after choosing Traditional Chinese:

```text
zh-Hant
```

The file is `~/.local/ThreeDimensionModeller/language`. The line ends with a newline. A test passes its own home directory into `MenuLanguage(...)` and does not read the developer’s leaf.

Invocation sample for the row this file owns. There is no `three-dimension-modeller language` command. On the open menu:

```text
three-dimension-modeller
4
43
```

That sequence opens the menu, opens the language board, and saves `zh-Hant`.

### 2.2 Why This Requirement Exists (Direct CIAO Alignment)

- **CIAO Principle 5 – SSOT** (https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao): One class owns the codes and the words. The menu picture does not keep a second catalog.
- **CIAO Principle 2 – Intentional**: English is the default. A locale variable does not change the menu.
- **CIAO Principle 21 – Dual Policies**: `language` is named here and on the CLI interface as not a verb.
- **CIAO Principle 22 – File modes**: The leaf is `0600` and its directory is `0700`.

## Under command line for normal user only

On Termux, Git Bash, Windows cmd, or the same class, the person runs `three-dimension-modeller` as the normal user. **This requirement:** saving the language file is this login’s home. Do not use administrator privilege, `sudo`, `apt`, or a dedicated system user to write it. Do not pipe a downloaded script into a shell. Type 1 and Type 2 are unused on Termux, Git Bash, and Windows cmd. Git Bash and Windows cmd do not call Termux `pkg`. Row 4 is numbered on those hosts the same way it is numbered on Linux.

## 3. Design Principles (CIAO / CIAO-Lite)

- **Caution:** An invalid file stays English and is not rewritten. A failed write keeps the previous code.
- **Intentional:** Thirteen codes, a block of twenty numbers, and one leaf.
- **Anti-fragile:** `THREEDIMENSIONMODELLER_LANG` can force a code for one process without touching the file.
- **Over-protect:** Reserved numbers warn and do not write. Back does not write.

## 4. Protection Rule (Sacred)

**Future AI assistants or maintainers MUST NOT**:

- Add `language` as an argv verb.
- Read `LANG` or `LC_ALL` to select the menu language, or restore gettext for this menu.
- Print reserved numbers 40 or 54–59, or write the leaf when one of those numbers is typed.
- Write the leaf on Back, on an empty Enter of Back, or on Esc.
- Translate the folder path, the clock, a directory name, or a leaf short such as `model`.
- Put the language file in the cache folder or under `/var/ThreeDimensionModeller`.
- Renumber row 4, or move system-log back onto row 4, to make room.
- Mark `TP-OOP-*` or `TP-TUI-01` through `TP-TUI-08` have from this file.

**Violating this rule is a critical menu-language regression.**

| AC-1 | Front row 4 opens the language board. Rows 41–53 show the endonyms. 40 and 54–59 are not printed |
| AC-2 | System-log is front row 3. Its children are 31, 32, and 33 |
| AC-3 | A pick writes `${HOME}/.local/ThreeDimensionModeller/language` mode `0600` and switches this process |
| AC-4 | Back, Esc, and a reserved number do not write. A failed write keeps the previous code |
| AC-5 | A missing or invalid leaf is English and is not rewritten. `LANG` does not select a code. `THREEDIMENSIONMODELLER_LANG` wins and does not write |
| AC-6 | `language` is not an argv verb. Leaf shorts stay English |
